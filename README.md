# CAMERA CALIBRATION
Camera calibration is a key skill in computer vision and robotics. It is essential for tasks like taking great photos, helping self-driving cars navigate safely, guiding surgical tools, and allowing humanoid robots to interact well with their surroundings. These distortions, if left unaddressed, can lead to inaccurate spatial mapping and flawed interpretations of the worldâ€”a critical failure point in any vision-driven system. Therefore, the ability to meticulously calibrate a camera, effectively eliminating these distortions, is not just a good practice but an absolute necessity for building robust and trustworthy perception systems.
